## Overview

Create a portfolio web page to showcase coding skills and completed projects. Use CSS grid function using placeholders where required. 

Make sure the webpage is responsive, all links work etc.

Placeholders to be replaced as projects completed. Styling and text to be enhanced accordingly as time goes on.

This README.md file will be updated as the page becomes a real portfolio and ceases to be a challenge covering above points.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Media queries
<br><br>
### What I learned

Using grid-area to define parts of the grid and then arrange in multiple ways using grid-template-areas makes positioning so much easier than both flex box and floats.
<br><br>
### Continued development

This project will be ongoing and showcase my latest projects, skils and resume.
